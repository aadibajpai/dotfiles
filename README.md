I'm still figuring out symlinks and the logistics of this tbh.

|Function|Software|
|---|---|
|*operating system*| Windows, WSL|
|*terminal emulator*| Windows Terminal| 
|*shell*| fish <3|
|*keyboard*| https://ilyabirman.net/projects/typography-layout/|
|*editor*| vim, PyCharm etc.|

I wrote a couple of fish functions to do some stuff for me regularly which was interesting.

Additionally, now I'm using vim more and more on wsl and over ssh sessions so I
am now the _proud_ owner of a very small .vimrc (although everyone just tells me to use emacs).

Okay, I'm using stow to manage these now. So much easier, thanks Ben.

## Why vim AND PyCharm??

I love vim in that it's right there in my terminal, super fast and minimal. However, it's not a substitute for a full fledged IDE when I need to work on something important or large, and I refuse to bloat my vimrc so much that it makes vim the very thing it swore to destroy. So I use vim for smaller work and PyCharm, CLion etc. for bigger projects or university work.
