# dotfiles

I'm still figuring out symlinks and the logistics of this tbh.

I'm especially proud of the `subl` binding, it was my first foray into getting something so hacky to work
in a shell script.

Anyway, here's an update.

I wrote a couple of fish functions to do some stuff for me regularly which was interesting.

Additionally, now I'm using vim more and more on wsl and over ssh sessions so I
am now the _proud_ owner of a very small .vimrc (although everyone just tells me to use emacs).

I want to figure out better dotfiles management too btw, apparently git stow is a good way to do it
but I need to look more into it.
