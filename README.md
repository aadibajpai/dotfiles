# dotfiles

I'm still figuring out symlinks and the logistics of this tbh.

*shell*: fish <3

*keyboard*: https://ilyabirman.net/projects/typography-layout/

Anyway, here's an update.

I wrote a couple of fish functions to do some stuff for me regularly which was interesting.

Additionally, now I'm using vim more and more on wsl and over ssh sessions so I
am now the _proud_ owner of a very small .vimrc (although everyone just tells me to use emacs).

I want to figure out better dotfiles management too btw, apparently git + stow is a good way to do it
but I need to look more into it.

Okay, I'm using stow now. So much easier, thanks Ben.
